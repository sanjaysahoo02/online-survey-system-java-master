Online Survey System

The idea of this project is to create a core java project that can accumulate the viewpoint of a targeted audience of a survey through the Internet. Based on that, the app can send the targeted audiences promotional emails and can launch online surveys. Any business can make use of this type of software to assemble feedback regarding the services or products they offer. We can build such functionality so that only

registered customers can cast their responses.
